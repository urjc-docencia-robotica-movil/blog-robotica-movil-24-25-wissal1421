# Global Navigation

In this project, we were tasked with implementing gradient-based navigation through a city. The assignment was quite dense, as it required calculating cost maps, expanding obstacles, and finally, executing the navigation itself. The navigation is semi-reactive, traversing the city based on the cost of neighboring cells. It took me longer than expected because I didn't have the car image in Unibotics. Below, I will explain the problems I encountered and the solutions I applied.

## Problem 1: Loading Only the Necessary Part of the Map

This was the first issue I faced. Given the structure of my code, I encountered many errors when trying to implement it as explained in class. To avoid leaving it unfinished and to prevent unnecessary obstacles from being analyzed, I applied a mask. This way, although the entire map loads the first time, the rest of the code ignores it.

## Problem 2: What Costs Should I Assign to Obstacles?

I was unsure about this because I could assign a very high cost that the map would never actually reach, but that didn't quite convince me. Ultimately, I decided to use infinite costs. This ensures that the map will always function correctly because it will never have infinite costs elsewhere.

## Problem 3: Map with Costs on Obstacles

Initially, I considered generating the cost map and expanding obstacles simultaneously. However, this approach was inefficient and didn't work as intended. Therefore, I decided to first load the general cost map and then expand the obstacles afterward.

## Problem 4: Narrow Streets

While navigating, the car would spend a lot of time turning and adjusting at narrow street intersections. To address this, I expanded the obstacle costs in a circular manner, which helped the car handle intersections more smoothly.

## Problem 5: Semi-Reactivity

At first, I structured all the code so that only the navigation part was in the main loop. Later, I changed this because the program was getting stuck in a while loop within the get_target() function. This wasn't acceptable, so I implemented a state machine in the main loop. One drawback of this method is the lack of clarityâ€”it becomes difficult to divide the code into multiple functions without having to return numerous variables, which can make the code less readable.

## Video

In order to show the videos, I must first explain that depending on when the cost map is shown, it loads faster or slower. In this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nIDVxXbFIuQkHJyNdc-cL3V94yYOf7Nd/view?usp=sharing) you can see how the cost and expansion map is shown each time it is modified and how it takes 1 minute to do so, while in [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nB4HAbwWAI69XId43ECTHDNhyL2JXjYD/view?usp=sharing) one it takes less since it is only shown once both are loaded. This happens because loading the map places a lot of load on the system.
